Then every cell which contains even the slightest fraction of an object, will be marked as occupied, and therefore blocked. cells which do not contain any part of an object/obstacle will be marked as free.

An example would be, in the topological representation of a building floor plan, each free room will be a node, and there will be an arc that connects each of these free rooms to the free hallway. The robot must have the required components to localize itself within each node and travel between nodes. "

Topological map is graphical representation of the environment, it represents characteristics of the environment not the geometrical qualities. we have nodes and edges. Nodes specifies some features and edges is a way to map from one node to another. In nodes we can add more semantic information like what is in the this room(tables, chair etc). Topological map could be hierarchical representation of the semantic information. Inside a node we could have ocuupancy grid map or topological map inside another topological map.  Two important constraints for robot to satify are:
* detect current position in the graph
* able to traverse between graphs nodes during motion. "
